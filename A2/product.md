 * ### Technical highlights: interesting bugs, challenges, lessons learned, observations, etc.
  * Alert bug: When the timer completes, an alert would be displayed. However, it would not scale down to the size of the extension during runtime. Instead, it would display.
  * Script error: Come across an error making it harder for us to run the script in the background.
  * ##### We were able to work through these bugs. And while debugging them we learned how to read and critique other team members’ code, learned how to use the JavaScript debugger, and got more practice reading through the Mozilla API’s.
 
* ### Reflect on your teamwork and process. What worked well, what  needs improvement.
  * #### What worked well:
    * Job distribution - Every member was able to do their part independently in a timely manner. There were neither complaints nor procrastination during the development.
    * MVP - We were able to achieve our minimum viable product before the deadline which gives us time to work on the features that will take our product to the next level.
    * We all collaborated using a shared github repository, this made it easy to read, and edit code while working on our extension.   
  
  * #### What needs improvement: 
    * Schedule conflicts - We had to work through finding a good time that we could meet without conflict.
    * Tools and Technology familiarity - None of the team members had prior experience with web development. It took us ample time to catch up on the required technologies. This caused us to have less time to build the actual product.

* ### Triage: What will you build for the final demo? 
  * We will develop the timer as it is the main function of our extension. Although the product is functioning, there are bugs that cause the extension to not run as smoothly. After the presentation, we plan to allocate our efforts into fixing the three bugs described above and any other bugs that can be discovered afterwards. Additionally, a part of the group will be working on the forbidden website list. However, the website list is not a mandatory function we chose to complete but simply something that would improve the quality of our final product.
