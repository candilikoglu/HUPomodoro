### Goal: Describe your project 
#### 1. What are you planning to build?
We are creating a study tool that uses the Pomodoro Method to help students stay on task and work effectively. The extension will allow the user to add a task, then start studying for a specific time frame with breaks also for a specific time window. During this period, if the user is working in marked “productive” sites the timer will continue for the study period. If the user is on other sites during the study period they will have an alert on screen and the timer will pause.

* Potential Features:
   * **Students** will be able to use pomodoro technique or set their own study & break time on the timer. They will be able to add website url's in which only the timer will work. If they go to a website not listed in the extension, timer will stop and display an notification. 
   * **Parental Featue** will allow parents to enter authorized websites. Students won't be able to change the websites unless they know the password. If the student goes to unauthorized page, both parties will be notified via a notification. 
   * **Alarm** notifies user when they are studying, need a break, and the break is over.
          

#### 2. Who are you building for? / Who it benefits? 
We are building it for:
 * students who need help focusing on studying or have problems taking breaks from online entertainment.
 * parents wo wants to keep track of their children's study progress whether they are physically in the same location or not, as well as keep children from losing focus.
      
#### 3. Why would they find what you want to build useful/valuable?
 Due to COVID, students not only had to be on their devices more than usual, but it became harder for them to focus in class since it was not in person. Although we are now back in in-person classes, some students are still unable to regain their original attention span before COVID. This extension will make them keep them focused while having adequate time for breaks. For parents, there are many who have trouble monitoring their children’s online activity and want to make sure that they are not on dangerous or inappropriate sites. Some also may need help in getting their kids to study for school without losing focus and going on sites that have nothing to do with their education.


#### 4. How would one validate that what you built was useful?
For students, they are able to focus more on studying and they are able to take less time off social media. For adults, they are able to monitor kids' online activities and progress. They will not have to be in the same location as their children.
